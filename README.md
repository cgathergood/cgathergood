### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Calum and I'm a Software developer taking a bit of a break ðŸ˜Ž
I started out as a native Android developer but have a tendency to float between different tech stacks, however I like to hover around frontend apps mostly ðŸ’» ðŸ“±

I've learned new technologies before and will do so again ðŸ’¡

I have experience building and leading technical teams ðŸ› 

Right now I'm working with React Native, Typescript, Node and GraphQL.

In the past I've worked with native Android Java/Kotlin, native iOS ObjC/Swift, Python, Angular and a little bit of Go.
